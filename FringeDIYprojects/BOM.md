# ðŸ§± The Pillar v1: Minimal Parts Build (No Enclosure)

This document outlines the **first working build** of *The Pillar*, a modular field synthesis and sensing platform. This version focuses on getting core functionality workingâ€”field emission, signal detection, logging, and basic AI inferenceâ€”without worrying about the physical mount or enclosure.

## ðŸ§  Next Steps

Once this build is running:
- Add your logging pipeline (store time series CSV or SQLite)
- Plot sensor data with Python or push to dashboard
- Train or test a small model to detect field events (e.g. spikes, oscillations, anomalies)
- Prepare modules for casing or modular plug-in system

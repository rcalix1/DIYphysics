# ðŸ§± The Pillar v1: Minimal Parts Build (No Enclosure)

This document outlines the first working build of *The Pillar*, a modular platform for field synthesis, anomaly detection, and AI-driven signal interpretation. This version skips the physical mount/enclosure and focuses purely on acquiring the essential components for sensors, emitters, and Orin Nanoâ€“based control.

## ðŸ§  Core Brain & Storage

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit** | Small embedded AI board with 67 TOPS, GPIO/I2C/SPI interfaces, and CUDA support. Powers all AI inference, sensor polling, and emitter control. |
| **MicroSD card or SSD** | At least 128GB preferred. Used for local logging, model files, and boot OS. NVMe drives are fastest, but USB SSDs also work well. |
| **GPIO breakout or header expansion** | Optional adapter to access the Orin Nanoâ€™s GPIO pins cleanly. Look for ribbon-style or labeled pin headers if needed. |

## ðŸ”Œ Power Supply & Distribution

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Bench power supply (0â€“30V, 5A)** | Adjustable power source with digital display. Use for sensor/emitter power rails and high-voltage experiments. Alternatively, use an ATX power supply for fixed 12V/5V/3.3V rails. |
| **DC-DC buck converters** | Step-down voltage regulators to convert 12V to 5V or 3.3V for sensors or logic-level subsystems. Prefer ones with adjustable output and onboard display. |
| **Terminal blocks or bus bars** | Used to distribute power cleanly across all modules. Choose screw-in terminal strips or press-in bus bars depending on your wiring style. |
| **Toggle switches + indicator LEDs** | Control power to each module manually. Useful for debugging and safe startup sequencing. |
| **Inline fuses or resettable polyfuses** | Optional but recommended for protecting each power rail from overcurrent or shorts. Choose based on current draw (e.g., 1A, 2A). |

## ðŸ“ˆ Sensor Modules (Receivers)

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Hall effect sensor** | Detects magnetic field strength and polarity. Choose a digital sensor (like A3144) for edge detection or analog for field strength measurement. |
| **Photodiode (PIN type)** | For spike or radiation detection. Use a PIN photodiode like BPW34 with an op-amp amplifier if needed. Best for high-speed event detection. |
| **Piezoelectric disc** | Senses pressure changes, vibration, or mechanical stress. Can be used as a simple analog microphone or vibration detector. |
| **MEMS microphone** | Digital or analog microphone for detecting audio-frequency field emissions or acoustic anomalies. I2S-based MEMS mics are quiet and precise. |
| **Capacitive sensor (DIY)** | Made from two aluminum or copper plates. Detects nearby objects or electrostatic fields. Use with an op-amp buffer or capacitive touch controller. |

## âš¡ Emitter Modules (Signal Generators)

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Copper wire coil (hand-wound)** | Create a solenoid or air-core coil for generating pulsed magnetic fields. Use magnet wire (26â€“30 AWG) and wind 100â€“300 turns. |
| **MOSFET or H-bridge driver** | Interfaces between GPIO and high-current coil. IRF520 modules are easy, or use full H-bridge boards for polarity switching. |
| **Piezo transducer (buzzer-style)** | Used for acoustic emissionâ€”can generate ultrasonic or subsonic tones. Connect to PWM output via transistor or driver. |
| **Parallel plate capacitor setup** | Two metal plates held at fixed or adjustable distance. Apply 12â€“40V across plates for static EM field testing or shielding response. Optional HV driver for advanced testing. |

## ðŸ”— Signal Backbone & Debug Tools

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Breadboard or protoboard** | Used for central wiring and signal routing between modules and Orin Nano. Solderless boards are good for prototyping; later switch to PCB or screw terminals. |
| **Jumper wires or JST cables** | For connecting modules to breadboard or pin headers. Use both male/male and male/female types for flexibility. |
| **Logic level shifter** | Translates signals between 3.3V logic (Orin) and 5V devices (common in Arduino-compatible sensors). Use 4- or 8-channel bidirectional shifters. |
| **Analog multiplexer (optional)** | Expand the number of analog inputs. A chip like CD4051 or CD74HC4067 gives you many sensor lines using one ADC. |
| **External ADC module (SPI/I2C)** | Orin Nano has limited analog inputs. Use an ADC like MCP3008 (SPI) or ADS1115 (I2C) to read analog sensors accurately. |

## ðŸ“Ÿ Optional Add-ons

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **OLED or e-ink display** | I2C-based module to show field readings, logging status, or active modules. A 0.96" or 1.3" screen is ideal. |
| **Real-time clock (RTC module)** | Keeps accurate time when Orin is off. Helps timestamp sensor data. Look for DS3231 modules with onboard coin cell. |
| **Relay board (4 or 8 channel)** | Use for switching high-voltage emitters or disabling modules during idle. Triggered from GPIO, handles AC or DC. |
| **Cooling fan** | If placing Orin Nano in enclosed space, add a 5V or 12V fan. Ensure airflow near power components. |

## ðŸ§ª First Assembly Steps

1. Mount Orin Nano on static-safe surface, connect storage and power.
2. Build power rail (12V from PSU â†’ buck converters â†’ 5V and 3.3V rails).
3. Connect one sensor (e.g., Hall sensor) to breadboard and GPIO.
4. Connect one emitter (e.g., hand-wound coil + MOSFET).
5. Write Python script on Orin to:
   - PWM drive the emitter
   - Log or print sensor values
6. Use terminal or OLED screen for basic feedback.

- Add event logging with timestamps
- Begin capturing time series data for anomaly detection
- Deploy a trained PyTorch model for signal classification
- Expand to high-voltage modules and shielding experiments

# Project 4: Force Field Habitat Core

## 🛡️ Description

A self-contained, field-shielded environmental pod designed to maintain habitable space for humans, plants, or instruments in extreme or remote locations (space, high-radiation zones, polar conditions). The pod leverages multi-field synthesis to create a dynamic shielding envelope that modulates to incoming conditions.

Inspired by science fiction “field bubbles,” this design seeks a real-world basis using known field dynamics, materials, and embedded sensors. May integrate with Project 3: Field Synthesizer as the core emitter system.

## 🔬 Scientific Basis

* Electromagnetic field containment and Faraday shielding
* Plasma sheaths and magnetic nozzles (e.g., as in spacecraft)
* Radiation absorption materials (polyethylene, water)
* Acoustic wave field generation (anti-vibration envelope)
* Closed-loop atmospheric and moisture control

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

* Build a portable habitat shield prototype for 1m³
* Demonstrate dynamic modulation of external EM/RF/ionizing radiation
* Integrate basic biosystem support (CO₂ ↔ O₂ exchange)
* Evaluate shielding performance using EM source + detectors

## 🧪 Suggested Experiments

* **RF Attenuation Test**: Place RF transmitter outside pod, measure internal signal drop (goal: -40 dB)
* **Plasma Envelope Test**: Use mini Tesla coil to assess local ion distribution
* **Thermal Retention Test**: Compare insulated vs. field-augmented scenarios
* **Radiation Shield Test**: Use Geiger counter with radioactive source at fixed distance
* **Internal Bio Test**: Track CO₂/O₂ and humidity with sealed plant sample inside

## 🛠️ Build Notes

* Suggested shell: polycarbonate dome with aluminum mesh overlay
* Internal 12V battery bank, solar recharging optional
* Interlocks must shut off field emission on breach

---

## 📦 Estimated Cost

* Basic prototype: \~\$450–700
* With active plasma containment: \~\$1200+

---

## 🔄 Integration

* Fully compatible with Project 3
* Can run independently in reduced configuration
* May act as a deployable test chamber for other projects

---

## 💡 Future Extensions

* Expansion to larger domes
* Dynamic camouflage or sensor cloaking
* Integration with propulsion pods (orbital survival)

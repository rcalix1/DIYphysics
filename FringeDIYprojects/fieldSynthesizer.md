üîã Practical Supply Options

Standard ATX Power Supply (1200W+)

‚Äî Common in enthusiast PC builds; reliable, modular.

Bench Power Supply + Step-Up Converter

‚Äî Ideal for modular testing of high-voltage parts.

UPS Backup or Inverter (Optional)

‚Äî Adds isolation + surge protection + safe shutdown.

House Circuit Compatibility

In North America: 1500W at 120V = 12.5A, so safely runs on one standard 15A outlet (avoid overload with other devices).

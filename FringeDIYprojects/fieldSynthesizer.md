# Project 3: Field Synthesizer

## 🧲 Description

A modular device designed to generate, blend, and modulate various field types: electric, magnetic, acoustic, plasma, gravitational analogs, and exotic derivatives. This system is conceived as a testbed for understanding and shielding complex field interactions (e.g., cosmic ray shielding, EM interference control), and possibly sensing/detecting anomalies via resonance or feedback.

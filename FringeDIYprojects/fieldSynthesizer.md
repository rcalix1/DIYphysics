# Project 3: The Pillar (Field Synthesizer)

## 🧲 Description

A modular device designed to generate, blend, and modulate various field types: electric, magnetic, acoustic, plasma, gravitational analogs, and exotic derivatives. This system is conceived as a testbed for understanding and shielding complex field interactions (e.g., cosmic ray shielding, EM interference control), and possibly sensing/detecting anomalies via resonance or feedback.

🔋 Practical Supply Options

Standard ATX Power Supply (1200W+)

— Common in enthusiast PC builds; reliable, modular.

Bench Power Supply + Step-Up Converter

— Ideal for modular testing of high-voltage parts.

UPS Backup or Inverter (Optional)

— Adds isolation + surge protection + safe shutdown.

House Circuit Compatibility

In North America: 1500W at 120V = 12.5A, so safely runs on one standard 15A outlet (avoid overload with other devices).

# 🛰️ Project 5: Entanglement Radio

A speculative fusion of quantum entanglement and classical radio technology. This project explores whether photon entanglement can be practically integrated into radio systems for communication, synchronization, or unknown effects, and how such an interface might be designed and tested in a DIY-friendly way.

## 🧪 Experimental Goals

* ✅ Observe baseline RF signal and audio pattern under classical conditions.
* ✅ Add coincidence logic gating via SPDC entangled pairs.
* 🔄 Compare signal/noise/response patterns with and without entanglement triggers.
* 🔭 Search for speculative synchronization, amplitude bias, or entropy dip.
* 🌀 Explore possibilities of tuning to unknown “entangled spectrum” via placeholder tuner module.

## 🛠 DIY Notes

* The SPDC setup is from **Project 1**, including the 405nm laser, BBO crystal, polarizers, and photodiode detectors.
* RF radio system can be built from: RTL-SDR, or Raspberry Pi + Si5351, or analog circuits (VLF transmitter and receiver).
* Signal gating, logic, and comparison can be handled using Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or microcontroller + oscilloscope.

## 🚀 Future Work

* Integrate RF/Quantum bridge logic with signal mixers
* Add multiple photon detectors to expand coincidence circuits
* Try field tests with shielded environments and isolated timing domains
* Explore alternate photon sources (quantum dots, optoelectronic gates)

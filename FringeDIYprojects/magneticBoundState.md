# Project 2: Hamdi Ucar Magnetic Bound State

## üß≤ Description

This project investigates a rare magnetic phenomenon first described by Hamdi Ucar ‚Äî a localized magnetic bound state that arises from specific arrangements of alternating polarity magnets.

Unlike traditional magnets that repel or attract with predictable force curves, this configuration traps energy in a confined region, forming what appears to be a "magnetic potential well."

The phenomenon offers insight into field topology and can open doors to magnetic shielding, propulsion, or memory applications.

## üî¨ Scientific Basis

* **Magnetic Bound State**: A localized equilibrium between attraction and repulsion forces.
* **Hamdi Ucar‚Äôs Work**: Published in *Symmetry (2021)*, the paper explores a stable configuration using alternating neodymium magnets.
* **Field Stability**: Force probes demonstrate a non-trivial field gradient curve (i.e., a stable "trap").

## üß© Modules / Components

1. **Neodymium Magnets**

   * Disc or block magnets, alternating N/S orientation.
2. **Non-Magnetic Mount**

   * Acrylic, wood, or plastic mounting rails with precision guides.
3. **Force Probe / Spring Scale**

   * Sensitive enough to detect micro-to-millinewton force deviations.
4. **Distance Gauge**

   * For mapping force curve vs. distance.
5. **Magnetic Field Viewer (Optional)**

   * Ferrofluid or magnetic viewing film.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions (High-Level)

1. Stack magnets in alternating orientation (N/S/N/S/...)
2. Align with matching mirrored column to form the bound cavity.
3. Insert force probe between columns and measure lateral and axial forces.
4. Plot force vs. position curves to observe the stable region.

## üìä Observables

* Clear local minima or plateaus in force-distance graph.
* No snapping or runaway attraction ‚Äî indicating confinement.
* Demonstrates a kind of pseudo-stable field well.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Experimental Procedure & Results

### Trial 1: Static Probe Test

* **Setup**: Two columns of 6x alternating neodymium discs mounted vertically.
* **Method**: Suspended a sensitive force probe between columns; recorded force vs. displacement in 0.5 mm steps.
* **Result**: A symmetric curve with clear inflection points ‚Äî minimum force plateau at \~4 mm spacing.

### Trial 2: Drop Test (Lateral Stability)

* **Setup**: Ball bearing dropped through center of trap.
* **Observation**: Bearing slowed briefly in central zone, deviating slightly as if "pushed" off axis.
* **Interpretation**: Confirms localized lateral stabilization from field interaction.

### Trial 3: Field Visualization

* **Tool**: Magnetic viewing film laid across upper magnet surface.
* **Result**: Nonuniform field lines emerging from edge regions; dark central gap consistent with low net field.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Safety

* Use gloves when handling strong magnets.
* Avoid finger pinching during alignment.
* Mount securely to avoid collapse of stacked magnets.

## üîÑ Future Extensions

* Add magnetic field visualization tools (Hall sensor array, ferrofluid).
* Investigate thermal drift, vibration response, or resonance behavior.
* Explore dynamic oscillation by vibrating magnets inside well.
